        <p>Hello! My name is Sharon Boluwatife Da-silva and I am from Akure, Ondo State/Nigeria. and I am excited to be part of the Web Fundamentals course at BYU-Idaho. 
            I have a deep passion for reading novels, finding joy and insight in a wide range of literary works. 
            Additionally, I am an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where I find great fulfillment in my faith and community service.
            In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, which is why I am particularly enthusiastic about this course. 
            I look forward to learning and growing alongside all of you this semester.</p>
